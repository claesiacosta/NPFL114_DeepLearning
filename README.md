# NPFL114 Deep Learning Course | MFF - Charles University
- Team up work
### The tasks are evaluated automatically using the [ReCodEx Code Examiner](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/).

The evaluation is performed using Python 3.8, TensorFlow 2.4.1, TensorFlow
Addons 0.12.1, TensorFlow Probability 0.12.1, TensorFlow Hub 0.11.0 and OpenAI
Gym 0.18.0. You should
[install the exact version of these packages yourselves](#faq_install).

### Teamwork

Solving assignments in teams of size 2 or 3 is encouraged, but **everyone has to
participate** (it is forbidden not to work on an assignment and then submit
a solution created by other team members). All members of the team
**must** submit in ReCodEx **individually**, but can have exactly the same
sources/models/results. **Each such solution must explicitly list all
members of the team to allow plagiarism detection using
[this template](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/team_description.py).**

### No Cheating

Cheating is **strictly prohibited** and any student found cheating will be punished.
The punishment can involve failing the whole course, or, in grave cases, being
expelled from the faculty. While discussing assignments with any classmate is fine,
each team must complete the assignments **by itself**, without using code it did not
write (unless explicitly allowed). Of course, inside a team you are expected to
share code and submit indentical solutions.
